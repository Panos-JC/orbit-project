# orbit-project
A Vue.js / Express.js / Neo4j project

## Description
This project was created as part of my undergraduated thesis on NoSQL graph databases. The implementation includes a simple social network application that focuses on tourism, where users can follow users, search or show interest in places they want to visit, log and rate their past visits. Using Neo4j, uers get friend recommendations based on common people they know, as well as place recommendations based on the activity of people they follow.
